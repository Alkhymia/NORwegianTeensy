# NORwegianTeensy
NORwegian Teensy family of NAND/NOR readers/writers, designed with PS3 downgrading in mind.

The NORwegian Teensy family of circuit boards utilize a Teensy++ 2.0 in conjuction with the NORway and NANDway software devolped by judges. https://github.com/hjudges/NORway

Currentlly the only model that has been produced is the NORwegian Teensy Socket Edition. It has two ZIF sockets, one for TSOP 48 NANDs and one for TSOP 56 NORs. Requires a 3.3v DC power supply.

In the works are the NORwegian Teensy Ultimate Edition and the NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition.

The Ultimate Edition has the two sockets and supports four different clip styles: NOR E3 Flasher Clip, NOR 360 Uni Clip, NAND 360 Uni Clip, and NAND 32pin 360 clip. It has also been designed so it can be powered using a microUSB cable with a 2 Amp phone charger.

The Clip Edition is the same as the Ultimate Edition, but without the two sockets.
